Description: This package provide two new metrics for evaluating cell clustering results
	 from single cell RNA-seq data: weighted Rand index (wRI)
	 and weighted normalized mutual information (wNMI). The new metrics
	 take into account the hierarchical structure of cell types 
	 in evaluating the clustering result.
